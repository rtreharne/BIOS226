# Setup for Topic 5 (start here)

## Step 1: Create a new R Project

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to `File > New Project...`.
3. Choose `New Directory` > `New Project`.
4. Name the project **Topic5** and choose where to save it.
5. Click **Create Project**.

RStudio will open a new session with the **Topic5** project as the working directory. Everything in this workshop will run from that project folder.

## Step 2: Download the required files into the project folder

Download these three files from GitHub and place them directly inside your **Topic5** project folder:

- `BIOS226_Topic5_Supervised_Learning_Workshop.Rmd`
  https://github.com/rtreharne/BIOS226/blob/main/week_5/BIOS226_Topic5_Supervised_Learning_Workshop.Rmd
- `generate_tumor_dataset.R`
  https://github.com/rtreharne/BIOS226/blob/main/week_5/scripts/generate_tumor_dataset.R
- `model_workflow_helpers.R`
  https://github.com/rtreharne/BIOS226/blob/main/week_5/scripts/model_workflow_helpers.R

In GitHub, click **Download raw file** (or right-click **Raw** and save) for each file.

## Step 3: Open the workshop notebook

1. In RStudio, open `BIOS226_Topic5_Supervised_Learning_Workshop.Rmd` from the Files pane.
2. You are ready to start once all three files are in the **Topic5** folder.
