## Installing and loading R packages

R packages extend what R can do.  
You only need to **install** a package once per computer, but you must **load** it every time you start R.

⚠️ **Important:**  
If you change computers or reinstall R, you will need to install packages again.

### Installing Biostrings (Bioconductor)

Biostrings is a bioinformatics package available via **Bioconductor**.

Add the following code to your script and run it line by line:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
```

This step may take a few minutes and will generate a lot of Console output — this is normal.

### Loading the package

Once installed, load the package using:

```r
library(Biostrings)
```

If this runs without errors, Biostrings is ready to use.

You must include `library(Biostrings)` near the top of your script whenever you want to use the package.
